### Rationale

Are you designing the right thing? Will your design meet the needs that the
client has expressed? Are the needs that the client has expressed really what
the client needs?

The best, most fitting designs are those grown in the context of a constant,
two-way communication between the designer and client.

Get something visible in front of your client as soon as possible. Get their
feedback, and see if the needs expressed in the engagement plan are still valid,
or if revisions and adjustments are necessary.

Try to find answers to the biggest questions first.
