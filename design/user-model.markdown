### Rationale

A design should be useful to the user and it should delight the user. In order
to give it either of those qualities, you need to know something about the user.

The user model document clarifies *who* the product is being built for and *how*
the product will be used.

User Types
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You may have multiple different types of users. For each type of user, record:

### User Description

A brief description this type of user of the product.


### Purposes of Use

Why this type of user would use the product, and to what ends.


### Modes of Use

The different ways in which the product will be used (e.g., sometimes as a
hammer, sometimes as a doorstop).


### Delightful Factors

The indescribable qualities of the product that will delight this type of user.
