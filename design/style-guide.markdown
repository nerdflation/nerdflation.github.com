You may want to institute a mutually agreed-upon style guide to shape the
**microdecsisions** each of your engineers will make.

Quoting Brooks:

> A style is a set of different repeated microdecisions, each made the same way
> whenever it arises, even though the context may be different. Consistency is
> reinforcing and self-teaching, because it confirms and encourages our
> expectations. It also solves the conflict between ease of use and ease of
> learning.
>
> A style consistently applied is a component, even if only the "dress," of the
> conceptual integrity of a product. It does more than delight -- it aids the
> comprehensibility of the design. In turn, this begets ease of initial
> learning, ease of use, ease of recollection after disuse, ease of maintenance,
> ease of extension. Style matters in all media of design, all genres.
>
> A clear style may not be a good style, but a muddled one never is.
