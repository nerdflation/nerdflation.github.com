These are some excerpts from my reading of *The Design of Design* by Fred
Brooks. They're just the parts that stood out the most to me; I highly recommend
reading the whole book.


A Good Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Firmness, usefulness, delight

A good design is one which:

- Meets the functional need of the client.
- Is robust and durable under stress.
- Delights the user.

### Conceptual Integrity

A good design will have **conceptual integrity**, the component principles of
which are:

- Orthogonality (do not link what is independent.)

    A change in one orthogonal function has no observable effect on any other
    function in the set.

- Propriety (do not introduce what is immaterial.)

    A function meeting an essential requirement is called *proper*. The opposite
    of propriety is *extraneousness*. Parsimony is a subset of
    propriety. Another is *transparency*, the property that a function's
    implementation produces no visible side effects.

- Generality (do not restrict what is inherent.)

    *Generality* is the ability to use a function for many ends. It expresses
    the professional humility of the designer, his conviction that users will be
    inventive beyond his imagination and that needs may change beyond his
    ability to forecast. The designer should avoid limiting a function by his
    own notions about its use. *When you don't know, grant freedom.*

    Generality is achieved through:
    - open-endedness (leaving space for future development).
    - completeness of function sets.
    - decomposition of functions into orthogonal components.
    - composability.

### Style

A good design will also have a consistent **style**.

A style is a set of different repeated microdecisions, each made the same way
whenever it arises, even though the context may be different. Consistency is
reinforcing and self-teaching, because it confirms and encourages our
expectations. It also solves the conflict between ease of use and ease of
learning.

Style, as an expression of the designer's personal and professional choices, is
a vehicle which helps limit the many degrees of freedom that design problems
have.

A style consistently applied is a component, even if only the "dress," of the
conceptual integrity of a product. It does more than delight -- it aids the
comprehensibility of the design. In turn, this begets ease of initial learning,
ease of use, ease of recollection after disuse, ease of maintenance, ease of
extension. Style matters in all media of design, all genres.

Habits seem to be a mechanism by which humans economize on mental effort, by
which we reduce the burden of decision making in everyday life.

A clear style may not be a good style, but a muddled one never is.


The First Major Challenge
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Know your limits and make provision for them.*

The first major challenge that a designer must address is that of *defining the
problem*: defining the decision to be made, the ends to be achieved, and the
means which may be used. In real-world practice, problems do not present
themselves to the practicioner as givens.  They must be constructed from the
materials of problematic situations which are puzzling, troubling, and
uncertain.

> Creative design is not a matter of first fixing the problem and then searching
> for satisfactory solution concept.  Creative design is a matter of developing
> and refining together both the formulation of a problem and ideas for a
> solution, with constant iteration of analysis, synthesis and evaluation
> processes between the two notional design 'spaces' -- problem space and
> solution space.

The fallibility and limited capacity of people and organizations prescribes a
design methodology that includes design, early prototypes, early user testing,
iterative incremental implementation, testing on a rich bank of test cases, and
regression testing after changes.

*In other words, we don't know exactly where we're going and we don't know
 exactly how to get there, so no amount of isolated thinking can produce a
 perfect plan at the outset. Instead, we need to deliberately explore possible
 problems and solutions until we find a satisfactory convergence.*


Becoming a Good Designer
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Study exemplars.
- Get more experienced designers to examine and critique your work.
