I am a professional nerd. Occasionally, I will write about my professional
nerditry.

If the voice in which I write here sounds a little too authoritative, a little
too overbearing, just remember that my main purpose for writing this blog is to
tell *myself* how to do things...and the only way I'll ever listen when I say
anything is if I speak to myself with firmness :)
